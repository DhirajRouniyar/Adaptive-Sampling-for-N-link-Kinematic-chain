# Adaptive-Sampling-for-N-link-Kinematic-chain  
# Abstract:   
Diverse sampling techniques are commonly employed in probabilistic planning approaches to determine paths.
However, no single sampling method universally excels in all scenarios. Challenges arise when existing sampling methods
underperform across an entire map. In response, we propose a novel solution by partitioning the workspace and employing
distinct sampling methods in different map segments. Leveraging machine learning, our approach identifies the most effective
sampling method for each map segment, resulting in a nonuniform dynamic sampling strategy. This innovative method
eliminates the need for oversampling across the entire map, offering an efficient path-finding solution. The project involved
an N-Link chain as the robotic model in our project.
